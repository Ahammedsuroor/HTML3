	      <center><h1><u>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</u></h1></center>
	      <p>A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine,  particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.

         <p>
             C++ is an object oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of C language. It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style." In certain scenarios, it can be coded in either way and is thus an effective example of a hybrid language.

         <p>
             C is a high-level and general purpose programming language that is ideal for developing firmware or portable applications. Originally intended for writing system software, C was developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix Operating System (OS) in the early 1970s.

         <p>
         	Java is a general purpose, high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. A small team of engineers, known as the Green Team, initiated the language in 1991. Java was originally called OAK, and was designed for handheld devices and set-top boxes. Oak was unsuccessful, so in 1995 Sun changed the name to Java and modified the language to take advantage of the burgeoning World Wide Web.
